# Architecture

## Current State

The project is a Python-first chess engine and AI workspace targeting Apple Silicon macOS. FEN, bounded PGN, bounded UCI, and terminal play are implemented. Swift, MLX training, and stronger AI components are planned for later work packages.

Implemented work packages:

- WP01: Python project bootstrap.
- WP02: Core board, square, piece, color, and move primitives.
- WP03: Legal move generation, special move handling, and perft benchmark.
- WP04: Game state/history, outcomes, complete-game simulation, and random-game benchmark.
- WP05: FEN parsing/serialization.
- WP06: Bounded PGN parsing/writing.
- WP07: Terminal UI and CLI play loop.
- WP08: Bounded UCI protocol with random legal best moves.
- WP09: Shared player protocol and random player.
- WP10: Classical MCTS baseline and simulations/sec benchmark.

## Engine Boundaries

The engine currently owns:

- 0..63 square indexing with `a1 == 0` and `h8 == 63`.
- Piece/color/move primitives.
- Immutable board snapshots with compact tuple-backed square storage.
- Side to move, castling rights, and en passant target state.
- Pseudo-legal move generation.
- Legal move filtering by check safety.
- Minimal `Board.apply_move()` for legal move generation and perft.
- `Game` snapshots with immutable position/move history and copied repetition state.
- Halfmove and fullmove counters at game level.
- Checkmate, stalemate, and pragmatic draw outcomes.
- Complete-game simulation with caller-provided move selectors.

Protocol support currently includes a bounded synchronous UCI loop in
`tinychess.protocols.uci`. It accepts standard handshake/readiness commands,
`ucinewgame`, `position startpos [moves ...]`, `position fen ... [moves ...]`,
`go`, `stop`, and `quit`. `go` returns a random legal `bestmove` or `bestmove
0000` for terminal/no-legal positions.

The AI layer owns the `Player` protocol, `RandomPlayer`, `MCTSPlayer`, and search configuration. These players interact with positions through public `Game.legal_moves` and `Game.play()` APIs rather than mutating engine internals.

The engine does **not** yet own:
- Full UCI features such as pondering, rich options, MultiPV, advanced time
  management, detailed info streaming, tablebases, or opening books.
- Strict FIDE claim-vs-automatic draw semantics.

Those are covered by later work packages in `PLAN.md`.

## Tooling

Use `uv` for reproducible setup and commands:

```bash
uv sync --dev
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check .
uv run mypy
uv run tinychess --help
```

A lightweight perft benchmark is available:

```bash
uv run python scripts/perft.py 3
uv run python scripts/random_game.py --seed 7 --max-plies 40
uv run python scripts/mcts_benchmark.py --simulations 25 --seed 7
```
